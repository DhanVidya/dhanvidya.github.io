> A debt is like an enemy. As one should destroy his enemy without any trace, a debt should be paid till the penny.

A debt by classic definition is borrowed money. Depending upon for what purpose you borrow sets the context to reason about 
whether it is good or bad debt. A good debt is something that you borrow in the hopes of getting more revenue that beats the interest rates of the debt. Even lenders who lend money rely exactly on that hope. But then again it varies from person to person
on where we draw the line. Venture Capital funding is one such example.

For simplicity, I am going to discuss only about personal debt i.e ones which individuals take
for buying a house, car etc.,

<h3><b><a name = "Agreement" class="inter-header">The Agreement</a></b></h3>

Whenever you buy something using debt, what we have to realise is that the something is never ours until and unless we pay off the debt. In most cases is is figuratively speaking i.e if you don't pay off the debt your credit score will be affected and of course there would be legal implications but in some cases this is literally speaking in the case of home loans and car loans. Problem is the loan/finance agreement is worded in a purposely complicated way that common people will find it difficult to understand.

> As said, if the payments are not made as per your agreement, it is deemed to be a default. The obvious fallout of this is that the lender/bank might repossess your car. Depending on your loan agreement, the lender/bank will send you a written notice of default asking you to pay the remaining balance on your Car Loan or face repossession. If the notice is not honoured within the time mentioned in it, your car will be repossessed.

From [bank bazaar](https://blog.bankbazaar.com/car-loan-default-what-when-and-how/). Similar is the case for a [home loan](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/what-happens-when-you-cannot-repay-your-home-loan-1510455.html). You could argue that for personal loans, they don't have anything to recover, but unless you are completely broke and there is nothing that the banks could do to recover they would not write it off as an NPA. So the next time someone comes and tells you that don't live in a rented home because its not yours then ask them if they paid their loan in full, because unless that is done the underlying asset is never truly yours.

> A debt is something that you borrow from your future.

<h3><b><a name = "PreClosure" class="inter-header">Pre-closing loans</a></b></h3>

Have you ever tried to pre-close a loan? The bank or the underlying financial entity would most definitely charge you something called pre-closure charges which is primarily for the purpose of recovering a part of the interest they would lose. One might even call this predatory tactics, but it is what it is.

Keep this clause in mind whenever you are borrowing.
