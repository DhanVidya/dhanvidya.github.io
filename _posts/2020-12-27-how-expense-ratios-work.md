In this article, we are going to discuss one of the most basic stuff that everyone should know regarding investing but it is often overlooked
or ignored.

For retail investors, mutual funds are probably the best way to invest in Stock markets over a long period of time. There are various types of mutual funds but all of them have something common with them.

- Regular vs Direct plan
- Total Expense Ratio or TER

We will look at regular vs direct plan in another article which is also equally important.

<h3><b><a name = "ExpenseRatio" class="inter-header">Understanding Expense Ratio</a></b></h3>

Expense ratio is the money that is taken by the fund house to manage your money. It is from where the fund manager, fund house and other folks who are involved in managing the fund get their money from. So how does it exactly work? Let's work with an example where we invest in a fund that has `1%` expense ratio and the amount that we invest is around 1 Lakh then below is the cost.

Year | Amount | Expense | Return
  1  | 100000 | 1000    |  N/A
  2  | 105930 | 1059    |  `7%`
  3  | 113260 | 1132    |  `8%`
  4  | 122219 | 1222    |  `9%`

`1%` might seem like small amount but they add significantly over time as indicated in the above table.
 
Few things to keep in mind.

- TER is not charged at bulk. Most mutual funds adjust this with the NAV (Net Asset Value) of the fund everyday and
  this makes it a little trickier because we don't see the fees charged exactly.
- TER is charged regardless of whether the fund is at loss or at a profit. Yes, the fund charges expense regardless of whether
  the fund is making profit or not.

In comparison to the above fund, if we choose a fund with only `0.1%` TER then the expense column will only be one tenth of the costs mentioned. Let's visualize the above table with a fund that charges only `0.1%` TER but returns are `1%` less than the high cost fund described above.

Year | Amount | Expense | Return
  1  | 100000 | 100     |  N/A
  2  | 105788 | 105     |  `6%`
  3  | 113080 | 113     |  `7%`
  4  | 121881 | 122     |  `8%`

Over four years, the cost difference between the costlier fund and cheaper fund even with `1%` less return from the cheaper fund comes to only around 338 <i class="fas fa-rupee-sign"></i>. Further conversations on choosing which fund is beyond the scope of this article but this goes to show just how much the cost eat up the returns. Note that SEBI actually has set limits on expense ratios and is capped at `2.25%` for equity mutual funds, but even this limit is set to prevent abuse of the TER and does not guarantee higher returns.

<h3><b><a name = "Conclusion" class="inter-header">Conclusion</a></b></h3>

Total expense ratio is just one parameter that should be used to evaluate mutual funds but one that is often ignored when comparing it with other funds. 
When talking about this topic one tends to think about other topics as well such as low cost funds and when to choose them, but since that is an extensive topic, I will write it in a separate article.
