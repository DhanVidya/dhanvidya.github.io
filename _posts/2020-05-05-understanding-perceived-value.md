This is one of the most crucial aspects that is often not understood/misunderstood/completely ignored when one tries to understand
finance and economics. After all, learning even a bit of human psychology helps a lot in making prudent decisions in money matters.
In this blog post, we are going to explore how money evolved over time and what made people respect money and how the rupee came into being.

<h3><b><a name = "History" class="inter-header">History of Money</a></b></h3>

In olden days and throughout history we have heard of people trading cattle, elephants, gold, silver etc., as money/valuable instruments. In fact, the word rupee is derived from the Sanskrit word rupya which means wrought silver and it can be traced as far back to the mauryan empire.

At this point, it is important to understand the [barter system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter) which is nothing but exchanging goods for goods. It took many forms and it was not until the 19th/20th century where the modern banking system was born. There are lots of documentaries/movies out there which talk about how money evolved. I encourage you to watch them. It will teach you about how humans perceived money throught our history.

<h3><b><a name = "IntrinsicAndExtrinsic" class="inter-header">Intrinsic value and Extrinsic values</a></b></h3>

Almost all of the money printed/stored digitally have an important characteristic i.e how it is being perceived. For example, INR will only be valuable in India and in some neighbouring countries. If you are somewhere in europe, you have to convert your currency to the local one and only then will it be useful there. Of course, now there are a lot of digital wallets/payment systems which allows you to do seamless international transactions, but the principle remains the same.

INR is valued in India because the Indian government recognizes it as the official currency of India. In Germany, Euro is considered as an accepted currency because the German government along with the European Union recognizes it. This might seem rudimentary but it is an underlying principle to keep in mind. Which brings is to an important distinction to be made - intrinsic value and extrinsic value of a financial instrument. Anything that has direct application to our survival such as food, medicine, real estate etc., have intrinsic values i.e their values will never become zero (this is not technically true, but you will see why I said this when I discuss inflation/hyperinflation in future articles) because they are in one way or the other necessary for all human beings.

Extrinsic value is highly volatile in nature. Let's take gold for example, although its price has been extremely volatile has no intrinsic value. In an artificial island where there are just 1000 people and if all of them decided that gold has no value then it will have no value. But even if they decided that real estate has no value, it doesn't matter. They will still need real estate to live in. So is my argument that real estate is better than gold? Well no, although warren buffet is [not in favour of gold](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/warren-buffett-bashes-gold-2019-2-1027977003), that is not my argument. The underlying distinction between an asset that has an intrinsic value and one which does not have an intrinsic value is a very thin line and at times invisible, but it should be understood if we are trying to reason about money and investments.

How to make that distinction? Well, look at if that asset is directly/indirectly important to day to day survival. If not, then probably it doesn't have that much intrinsic value. Where we draw the line entirely depends on you. But we have to use extreme prudence and not use historical/emotional context to do so.

<h3><b><a name = "DemandAndSupply" class="inter-header">Demand and Supply</a></b></h3>

Another important factor that determines the value of a financial instrument is demand and supply. In a vegetable market and when there is abundant supply of tomatoes and not much demand then the sellers would automatically reduce the prices so that buyers will be tempted to buy more tomatoes instead of other vegetables. Of course its not that straighforward all of the time and multiple factors also come into play.

In stock markets, supply and demand may mean liquidity/free flow of money in the market. If people have very less money, then you will not find people to sell it to and that means you have to lower your profits to convince the buyers who are very less in number. This principle is applicable everywhere but may exist in inverse as well. Consider precious jewels, their prices are not necessarily controlled by demand/supply but rather with the perception of value. The yellow metal, diamonds, rubies have always been extremely costly because of perception of value principle. Also reading about the [paradox of value principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_value) also explains it a lot. Another main reasons and probably one of the core reasons of value perception is limited supply of the commodity. Let's just say gold is not a rarity anymore and is as available as let's say copper (Ignoring extraction costs and other factors). Then suddenly the price of gold will drop and it will have equal or even lesser value than copper. This is one of the core principles behind [bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) which is a crypto currency. This is an advanced topic which we will deal with in a later blog post. 

<h3><b><a name = "Conclusion" class="inter-header">Conclusion</a></b></h3>

So we saw how value perception was in olden days and also how people view the value of a particular commodity and whether it is intrinsic or extrinsic. Demand/Supply is another classic principle that exists from time immemorial. These disparities one might call it exist everywhere from teachers being paid low salaries to pop culture musicians having billions in their assets. It is important to understand these principles from the right perspective so that you can cut down on all the misinformation and understand things the right way.
