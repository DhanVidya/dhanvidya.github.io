<h3><b><a name = "BookReading" class="inter-header">The Habit of book reading</a></b></h3>

In this internet and social media age why would someone read a book? The answer has to do with the amount of distractions these media sites bring. Have you ever tried to just see one video and then close the tab? If yes, then you have incredible focus to begin with. For the vast majority of the population they are tricked into watching more videos. This is not a bug actually, but a feature. The system has been designed in such a way you keep you continously engaged for a very long time. There has been several discussions about these but I encourage you to watch the Netflix documentary - The Social Dilemma. We spend hours staring into the screen and suddenly at the end of the day, we don't have any time. 

That's enough talk about social media, but I have to talk about another important topic called attention span and instant gratification. Video consumption has tremendously increased because of internet bandwidth availability and their durations have continously become shorter down to even 20 seconds. The TikTok platform is entirely built upon this concept. Our attention span has decreased a lot due to this and we find it very difficult to sit and learn/concentrate for more time. Studying books can increase your attention span and help a lot in concentration. I am not going to quote some research paper here, there are lots out there which you can search for, but I am saying from personal experience. It has also helped me in work as well.

Now that I have explained why should start reading books, let me explain why e-ink based readers is probably the best investment you can make regarding to books. Now the main advantage of it is e-ink technology. There are lots of videos on the internet explaning the advantages, but in summary e-ink is not based on the traditional LCD/LED screens that exist today. There is no concept of backlight and refresh rate/FPS here (videos are basically just images that are captured continously). Hence there is very less strain and is basically like reading an actual book.

Kindle is of course from Amazon and is mainly used to read e-books and based on e-ink technology. There are lot of e-ink readers out there but Kindle has the most widely available books (through Kindle unlimited) and has a solid platform on which it is built upon. You can also load your existing e-books after converting them to a format called `.mobi` which is specific to Kindle using a free software called [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/). It is probably the most battle tested/used e-ink reader out there so you can just go buy them without second thoughts.

I haven't listed the obvious advantages such as

- Obviously saves a lot of space compared to physical books.
- Reading with no external light sources. Kindle has something fascinating called [front lit screen](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/tablets/kindle-paperwhite2.htm).
- Travel friendly. You can take several books with you but most importantly is that you can access them from anywhere
  using an internet connection.
- Pocket friendly. E-Books are far cheaper than their physical book alternatives because there is no manufacturing cost involved.
- Inbuilt dictionary which does not require any internet connection.
- Font size adjustments. 
- Costlier versions of Kindle even have water resistance, free 3G/4G connection for downloading books and much more.

You might find conflicting studies online regarding advantages of Kindle and E-Ink readers in general. But all I can say is decide for yourself. I have found a significant difference in reading on Kindle vs Tablets/Laptops.

Traditional books are definitely special. But for all practical purposes and doing a very small part in saving the planet/lesser carbon footprint, choose Kindle.
