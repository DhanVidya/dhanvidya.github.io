Real estate in India is one of the most used asset classes. People love their real estate assets to the level that they even go religious over it. In this article we explore what are the hidden costs associated with real estate that people tend to often ignore when calculating their returns.

<h3><b><a name = "HiddenCosts" class="inter-header">Hidden costs</a></b></h3>

A typical real estate transaction goes through a lot of work. Below costs/points are considering purchasing an empty land/plot and not something like a constructed apartment as those can vary wildly.

One time expenses (During buying/selling)

- Stamp duty. 

  This is usually incurred when registering for a property. In the state of Karnataka as an example, the stamp duty at the time of writing this article comes to around 3% which was reduced from 5% to boost demand. So for a property worth 50 lakhs, the stamp duty alone comes to around 1.5 lakhs.

- Registration cost.
  
  Many people confuse this along with stamp duty but it is separate. This comes to around 1% of the market value of the property. So again for a property worth 50 Lakhs, it comes to around 50K.    

- Brokerage fee.

- Advertisement for sale.

  Free ads do not garner views, many websites do not show it up the ranking for obvious reasons. Some do not even allow to post free ads. Money is to be spent here. This is another reason why brokerage is given which is several times more than placing a typical ad.

- Time spent in searching for buyers and sellers.

- Capital gains tax.

  This can be avoided under `Section 54F` but you are just postponing of payment rather than exemption. There are several other restrictions as well.

- Legal fees.
  
  Fees spent to check whether the real estate fulfills all legal parameters.

- Auditor fees.

  Fees given to a Chartered Accountant or Auditor for tax calculation and savings.

Recurring expenses (During the holding period)

- Property tax.

- Maintenance costs.
 
  Given to a broker or someone toy/atake of property or driving down there to check if the property is in good condition. 

There are some exemptions to the above rules but the overall message that I want to put across is that there is much more than what meets the eye.

Real estate is ridden with black money/unaccounted money which makes it another challenged when the government brings in more and more stricter laws and curbs.

This blog post is not to demotivate investors from investing into real estate, but to bring to the table these seemingly ignored/hidden costs. So the next time you calculate returns, keep these in mind. Tracking them meticulously may not be practical, but keep a rough figure in mind for all of these to add/adjust in returns.
